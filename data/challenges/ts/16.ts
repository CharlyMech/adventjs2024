/*
The elves are working hard to clear paths filled with magical snow ❄️. This snow has a special property: if two identical and adjacent snow piles are found, they disappear automatically.

Your task is to write a function to help the elves simulate this process. The path is represented by a string and each snow pile by a character.

You need to remove all adjacent snow piles that are the same until no more moves are possible.

The result should be the final path after removing all duplicate piles
