/*
The elf programmers are creating a small magical assembler to control the machines in Santa Claus's workshop.

To assist them, we will implement a simple interpreter that supports the following magical instructions:

- MOV x y: Copies the value x (which can be a number or the content of a register) into register y
- INC x: Increments the content of register x by 1
- DEC x: Decrements the content of register x by 1
- JMP x y: If the value in register x is 0, then jumps to the instruction at index y and continues executing the program from there.

Expected behavior:

- If an attempt is made to access, increment, or decrement a register that has not been initialized, the default value 0 will be used.
- The jump with JMP is absolute and goes to the exact index indicated by y.
- Upon completion, the program should return the content of register A. If A did not have a defined value, it returns undefined.

			case "INC":
				registers[arg1] = (registers[arg1] || 0) + 1;
				break;
			case "DEC":
				registers[arg1] = (registers[arg1] || 0) - 1;
				break;
			case "JMP":
				if ((registers[arg1] || 0) === 0) {
					pointer = parseInt(arg2, 10);
					continue;

  Step-by-step execution:
  0: MOV -1 C -> The register C receives the value -1
  1: INC C    -> The register C becomes 0
  2: JMP C 1  -> C is 0, jumps to the instruction at index 1
  1: INC C    -> The register C becomes 1
  2: JMP C 1  -> C is 1, the instruction is ignored
  3: MOV C A  -> Copies register C to A. Now A is 1
  4: INC A    -> The register A becomes 2
